# 🏡 Real Estate Management System

Welcome to the *Real Estate Management System*, a modern and user-friendly platform designed to simplify buying, selling, and renting properties online. This project aims to bring transparency, convenience, and trust to real estate transactions through secure document handling, verified listings, and seamless interaction between buyers, sellers, and tenants.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The *Real Estate Management System* is a full-featured web application that enables:

* *Tenants* to search for houses based on location, budget, and preferences.
* *Buyers* to browse and purchase land or properties with clear documentation and verification.
* *Sellers* to list properties with accurate details, upload legal documents, and complete registry processes online.

This system ensures all real estate processes are efficient, reliable, and paperless.
